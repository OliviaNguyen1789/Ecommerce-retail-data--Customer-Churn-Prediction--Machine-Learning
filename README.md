## I. Introduction

### Project Aim:
- Develop a Random Forest machine learning model to predict churned users for an e-commerce company.
- Use K-means clustering to segment churned users and recommend tailored promotions based on their behavior.
  
### Stakeholders: 
- Data analysts & business analysts
- Marketing team.

## III. Exploring churn users' behaviour

### 1. Data Cleaning

#### Handle missing values

<img width="599" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-07 at 11 33 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a8ecd47-73cb-4ed6-afb0-b3af71b7e3af" />

Because % mising values > 20% and disperse in many columns --> using ML model to impute missing value

#### Handle duplicate values

The dataset has no duplicate values.

#### Univariate Analysis

*   Tenure: right-skewed, most customers clustered in 0 - 20
*   WarehouseToHome: majority of customers having short distances (below 40).
*   HourSpendOnApp: centered around 2-3 hours
*   NumberOfDeviceRegistered: centered around 3-4 devices
*   SatisfactionScore: mean at 3, suggesting generally moderate to positive customer satisfaction levels.
*   NumberOfAddress : most customers have 1-5 addresses, several outliers having up to 22 addresses 
*   OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear: growth in customer spending, centered around 13-18%
*   CouponUsed: most customers using 0-2 coupons, some outliers using up to 16
*   OrderCount: most customers placing 1-3 orders and several outliers up to 16 orders
*   DaySinceLastOrder: Most customers have ordered recently (within 0-10 days)
*   CashbackAmount: cashback distribution is complex, a cluster of high outliers around 300


#### Outlier Detection
