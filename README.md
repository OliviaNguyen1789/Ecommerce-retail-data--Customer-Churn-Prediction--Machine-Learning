## III. Exploring churn users' behaviour

### 1. Data Cleaning

#### Handle missing values

<img width="599" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-07 at 11 33 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a8ecd47-73cb-4ed6-afb0-b3af71b7e3af" />

Because % mising values > 20% and disperse in many columns --> using ML model to impute missing value

#### Handle duplicate values

The dataset has no duplicate values.

#### Univariate Analysis

*   Tenure: right-skewed, most customers clustered in 0 - 20
*   WarehouseToHome: majority of customers having short distances (below 40).
*   HourSpendOnApp: centered around 2-3 hours
*   NumberOfDeviceRegistered: centered around 3-4 devices
*   SatisfactionScore: mean at 3, suggesting generally moderate to positive customer satisfaction levels.
*   NumberOfAddress : most customers have 1-5 addresses, several outliers having up to 22 addresses 
*   OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear: growth in customer spending, centered around 13-18%
*   CouponUsed: most customers using 0-2 coupons, some outliers using up to 16
*   OrderCount: most customers placing 1-3 orders and several outliers up to 16 orders
*   DaySinceLastOrder: Most customers have ordered recently (within 0-10 days)
*   CashbackAmount: cashback distribution is complex, a cluster of high outliers around 300


#### Outlier Detection

### 4. Find out feature importance

<img width="821" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-07 at 11 46 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7c4ba95-f6c3-4cba-b6b9-d98ab9708de6" />

<img width="975" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-07 at 11 46 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0f29c5d-6ce9-4cd2-8730-944183d5a92a" />

The figure shows that Tenure, CashbackAmount, WarehousetoHome, Complain, DaysinceLastOrder have a strong impact on churn.

#### Explain the Impact of Feature importance

**Insights:**

- New customers --> More likely to churn
- Lower cash back amount --> More likely to churn
- Higher distance from warehouse to home --> More likely to churn
- High Complain --> More likely to churn

**Recommendations:**

- For new custotmers: Offer appealling discount or loyalty points and implement onboarding programs to improve customers' engagement
- For high tenure customers: Provide exclusive loyalty perks .
- For low cash back customers: introduce a tiered loyalty program (higher spending = more cashback).
- Distance: Offer free/discounted delivery for high-risk customers; Optimize fulfillment centers.
- Fast response to customers' complain, offer compensation for severe issue.

| New customers --> higher churn risk                  | Boost new customer engagement through personalized recommendations and exclusive discounts, fostering long-term brand loyalty.|
| Lower cash back amount --> higher churn risk         | Offer increasing cashback percentages based on total spending, encouraging repeat purchases and long-term engagement.         |
| Higher distance from warehouse --> higher churn risk | Offer free/discounted delivery for high-risk customers; Optimize fulfillment centers.                                         |
| High Complain --> higher churn risk                  | Build long-term customer trust by addressing complaints swiftly, following up proactively, and offering personalized solutions that enhance satisfaction. |
| Customers with recent orders --> higher churn risk   | Implement a quick feedback mechanism after purchase/delivery and analyze this trend across customer segments.                 |
