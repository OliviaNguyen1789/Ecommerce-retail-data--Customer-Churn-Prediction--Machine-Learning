## I. Introduction

### Project Aim:
- Develop a Random Forest machine learning model to predict churned users for an e-commerce company.
- Use K-means clustering to segment churned users and recommend tailored promotions based on their behavior.
  
### Stakeholders: 
- Data analysts & business analysts
- Marketing team.
